# Titanic-Survival-prediction

# Overview
This project aims to predict whether a passenger survived or perished aboard the Titanic based on various features, such as age, sex, class, and other personal details. This is typically approached as a classification problem using machine learning algorithms.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle Titanic competition. It consists of passenger details like:

* PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.
* Pclass: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
* Name: Name of the passenger.
* Sex: Gender of the passenger.
* Age: Age of the passenger in years.
* SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
* Parch: Number of parents/children aboard.
* Ticket: Ticket number.
* Fare: Amount of money the passenger paid for the ticket.
* Cabin: Cabin number (may be missing).
* Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

# Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. The target variable is Survived, where:

* 0 = Did not survive
* 1 = Survived

# Steps Involved
1. Data Exploration
* Analyzing the dataset to understand its structure and check for missing or outlier values.
* Visualizing relationships between features and the target variable (Survived).
* Data Preprocessing

2. Handling missing values.
* Encoding categorical features (e.g., Sex, Embarked).
* Scaling and normalizing numerical features if necessary.
* Model Selection

3. Various machine learning models can be used for this problem, including:
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees
* Random Forests
* Model Evaluation

4. Evaluate models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Cross-validation techniques to ensure the model generalizes well.
Hyperparameter Tuning

5. Use techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to tune hyperparameters for better performance.
Final Model

6. Select the best-performing model and apply it to the test dataset to make predictions.
# Installation & Usage
Prerequisites
 * Python (>=3.7)
 * Jupyter Notebook (optional)
 * Required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

# Results
The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 83.8%

Feature importance analysis showed that gender, fare, and class were key predictors of survival

# Conclusion
